ðŸ”¹ Features

Visualize sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

Visualize searching algorithms like Linear Search and Binary Search.

Dynamic array size: Users can adjust the number of elements to visualize different scenarios.

Adjustable speed: Change the visualization speed to observe algorithm behavior.

Interactive UI: Start, pause, reset, and replay animations easily.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Visualization: DOM manipulation for dynamic bars representing array elements

Optional Libraries: None (vanilla JS implementation)

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

Users select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.

Input the array size and optionally a target value (for searching algorithms).

Click Start, and the algorithm executes step by step, highlighting comparisons and swaps.

Users can observe how the array elements change over time, helping them grasp the algorithm logic visually.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Add pathfinding and graph algorithms visualizations.

Integrate color themes and responsive design for better UX.

Provide algorithm complexity information during visualization.
